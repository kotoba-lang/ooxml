   map by hand with 1-3 fabricated paths; this is the first real Word
   package (16 real parts: styles/numbering/footnotes/theme/settings/
   webSettings/fontTable/docProps/comments, all real Word part names) this
   classifier has ever seen -- confirms office-part-pattern picks out only
   word/document.xml and doesn't spuriously match any of Word's other
